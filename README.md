 Introduction to Programming Techniques Project

Paint for Kids, Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering, Cairo (September 2022-January 2023): Project assigned for the Introduction to Programming Techniques course.

•	My first hands-on C++ and object-oriented programming experience, which entailed strategic code reuse and cautiously abiding by Design Principles, most relevant of was SRP (single responsibility principle) for my classes, and careful management of dynamically allocated memory

•	I wrote the dynamic ‘play mode’ of the program, ensuring that the shapes are correctly fetched from the maestro class, then sorting and hiding them based on the game mode the user has selected
